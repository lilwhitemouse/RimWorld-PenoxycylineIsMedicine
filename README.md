# Penoxycyline Is Medicine
Mod for RimWorld to make Penoxycyline a Medicine instead of a drug.

I have medicine cabinets in my Deep Storage mod, and it's annoying to have to go hunting for penoxycyline in the "drugs" category.  Yes.  It's a drug.  No, I want it with medicine.

Lo.  Penoxycyline is a preventative medicine now.

(This removes the default Drugs category for PenEtc and adds Medicine.  Should be compatible with anything else that puts Penoxycyline in a different category, if you want it in Medicine too.)

Installation:
1. Make a directory PenoxycylineIsMedicine in your RimWorld's Mods folder
2. Put these files there.
3. Stay healthy.
