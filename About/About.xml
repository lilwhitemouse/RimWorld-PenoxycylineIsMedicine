Penoxycyline Is Medicine

I have medicine cabinets in my Deep Storage mod, and it's annoying to have to go hunting for penoxycyline in the "drugs" category.  Yes.  It's a drug.  No, I want it with medicine.

Lo.  Penoxycyline is a preventative medicine now.

(This removes the default Drugs category for PenEtc and adds Medicine.  Should be compatible with anything else that puts Penoxycyline in a different category, if you want it in Medicine too.)
