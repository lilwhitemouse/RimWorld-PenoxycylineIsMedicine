Penoxycyline Is Medicine

I have medicine cabinets in my Deep Storage mod, and it's annoying to have to go hunting for penoxycyline in the "drugs" category.  Yes.  It's a drug.  No, I want it with medicine.

Lo.  Penoxycyline is a preventative medicine now.

This removes the default Drugs category for PenEtc and adds "Medicine." If you have another mod that puts Penoxycyline into some category, and you want to keep it in that category, try loading this second.
